# Welcome to the Gitverse

## An experiment in community authored science fiction.

### What is the "Gitverse"?

The Gitverse is an experiment.  Rather than writing a book or story and then having fans produce unofficial "fan fiction", what happens if you let the fans be the creators from the very beginning? How detailed and how interesting of a universe can an unlimited number of people working together create?

### Why call it the Gitverse?

Even though it was built for coding, it seems like Git has all of the right functionality to make this whole idea work. From there, Gitverse just sounded catchy.

### Where did this idea come from?

I, C.E. Ulyssian, was at a science fiction writer's convention (http://www.bubonicon.com) and found myself really annoyed with many of the authors. Some of them were great, but many seemed to belittle their fans and several spoke poorly of "fan-fiction". They seemed happy to have fans who were willing to pay the bills, but the idea that someone else could contribute to their world or their stories seemed to threaten them, as if copyright was more important than creation.

Granted, they were professional authors trying to feed themselves, and they think restricting things to their own imaginations at the exclusion of others helps them do that.

Then it struck me. Software engineers and programmers used to think that way, but now some of the core technologies of the modern age are open source.

So here it is… open source science fiction.

### Why a science fiction universe?

First, that my personal area of writing interest.

Second, I think there are more people who like sci-fi and GitHub than there are people who like historical romance fiction and GitHub.

Third, having a whole universe to play in gives us all the ability to spread out if we want to.

### What is the "Gitverse Canon"?

The goal is to create a consistent fictional universe in which all of these stories can take place, all operating under the same basic frameworks of physics, space, and time as imagined by the community. 

To that end, the Master Branch of the Gitverse Repo is referred to as the Gitverse Canon.  Anything added to it is to be correct and consistent.  Minor deviations for the sake of telling a good story are fine.  Major deviations will either be edited to be consistent or left off in their own branch.  Or, if they're good enough, they can replace the Canon itself.

### What if my story or vision of the universe is really interesting but doesn't match the Gitverse Canon?

Awesome!  You should keep writing and adding to it.  There is absolutely nothing that says the Gitverse Canon is going to be the most interesting version or give rise to the best stories. Fork the Canon at any point and run with it! That's the whole idea.

### How will this work?

I will add a few short stories that take place in my vision of the Gitverse.  I'll add expanding notes to the Gitverse Repo Wiki to make it easy to tell how things work and to keep track of the facts as they stand.  From there, you can do with it whatever you like… preferably contributing back to the Gitverse Cannon.

Find a typo? Fix it.

Think of a better ending? Change it.

Have a completely different story? Write it.

It's *our* Gitverse.

### What about copyrights?

The whole Gitverse, and anything based on it, is published under a minor variation to the MIT License.  It differs only in that it refers to "literature" instead of "software" and that it requires a link back to http://www.gitverse.org be included prominently in any derived works.

That being said, you can do anything you want with it, including sell your work, so long as the proper attributions are made and the terms of the license are followed.
